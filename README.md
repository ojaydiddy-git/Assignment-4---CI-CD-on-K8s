# cdevops-jenkins
k8s lab to install jenkins and use it from github and gitea

TLDR;

```bash
ansible-playbook up.yaml
```

This is intended to be run on a machine with access to a kubernetes cluster, It also may be helpful to use docker for this part. If you are using this for class you should have to vsphere virtual machines. 1 will have truenas on it, the other stock ubuntu with support for a codespace.

In assignment 3 you added gitea to your kubernetes cluster

```

Your job is to edit the up.yaml to add jenkins to your cluster and down.yaml to remove it. You will also need to expose jenkins with the ngrok or traefik and cloudflare ingress, as you did with the previous assignment.

Submit links to all 3 repositories://///////////

1. this repository with your up.yaml and down.yaml for running jenkins on your cluster.
2. your github repository with the fork from the article and a Jenkinsfile.
3. your gitea repository with the fork from the article and a Jenkinsfile, exposed with the ngrok or traefik and cloudflare ingress
